I created a Track Suggester quiz that asks the user to answer five questions regarding their interests using a multiple choice style form and will return an answer as to which track they should take at Epicodus. This project continues to display my beginner proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as utilizing Bootstrap and jQuery._
