        <div id="answer-css">
          <h1>CSS/Design Track</h1>
          <h3>Congratulations, <span class="name"></span>, you should take the CSS/Design Track.</h3>
          <p>Why, you ask? You selected that you would like to work on front-end development. Since this is the only track we offer, CSS and Design is going to be the best option for you. Front-end developers spend their time making things look and work well, obsessing over layouts, navigation, colors, and design.</p>

        <div id="answer-ruby">
          <h1>Ruby/Rails Track</h1>
          <h3>Woohooo, <span class="name"></span>! You got the Ruby/Rails track!</h3>
          <p>Ruby is a favorite language of developers building interactive web applications. If an app involves users creating accounts, entering information, and interacting with dynamic content, there's a good chance it is built with Ruby. Ruby became popular because the Rails framework, which is written with Ruby, simplified many of the common tasks associated with building web applications. It's most popular with startups and smaller companies who are looking to build their product quickly.</p>

        <div id="answer-php">
          <h1>PHP/Drupal Track</h1>
          <h3>Hi, <span class="name"></span>! Your suggested track is the PHP/Drupal track.</h3>
          <p>PHP is most used in content-heavy websites with relatively little user interaction. The most popular content management systems - Wordpress, Drupal, and Joomla - are all written in PHP, and everything from local restaurants' websites up through large complex government deployments are built with these tools. If you're keen to work for an agency that builds websites for clients, or if you like the idea of building out sites for brands, businesses, and organizations, PHP is a great direction to go.</p>

        <div id="answer-csharp">
          <h1>C#/.NET Track</h1>
          <h3>Hey there, <span class="name"></span>! Your suggested track is the C#/.NET track.</h3>
          <p>C# is most popular among bigger established businesses, often for building internal software. Because it's been around for a long time and has the backing of Microsoft, it is one of the most in-demand languages in the job market. C# has also been going through a bit of a rebirth lately, with Microsoft open sourcing the language and surrounding platform, porting it to run on Mac and Linux, and incorporating many of the best features of other languages. If you like the idea of working for a larger company on business software, C# is a great choice.</p>
